# User Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using a Pi Pool image you need only reference this material until we start configuring the server.
{% endhint %}

## Create the ada user

Create a new user and add them to the sudo group.

```bash
sudo adduser ada && sudo adduser ada sudo
```

### Change password

You can change the ada users password at anytime with.

```bash
passwd
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Careful where you use sudo. For example issuing 'sudo passwd' would change the root password. This seems to be a place where new users get confused.
{% endhint %}

### Login as ada

Let's add our ssh public key to our new $USER ada's authorized\_keys file. Then we can log in as ada and delete the default 'ubuntu' user.

```bash
# drop back into your local terminal
exit
```

Use ssh-copy-id to add your public key to ada users authorized\_keys file.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <ed25519-keyname.pub> ada@<server-ip>
```

and ssh into the Pi as ada.

```bash
ssh ada@<server-ip>
```

Test that ada is in the sudo group by updating your package lists and upgrading the system.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Updating Ubuntu is going to take 10 minutes or more unless they update the image used with rpi-imager.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

If that was successful we can delete the default ubuntu user and it's home directory.

```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home ubuntu
```

## Harden ssh

Edit OpenSSH's configuration file and make the following changes with Nano text editor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out this [nano cheat sheet](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html) I just found! 

All the \# commented out values in sshd\_config are the default values. Remove the pound sign and change the value to match below. They will be loaded the next time systemd restarts ssh.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use ctrl+k to clip lines in nano. From the top of the file you can use it to cut out the whole file and paste this one in with ctrl+v or ctrl+shift+v depending on your system.  ctrl+o to save and ctrl+x to exit.
{% endhint %}

```bash
#	$OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.103 2018/04/09 20:41:22 tj Exp $

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

{% hint style="info" %}
I am not a proponent of changing default ports when I don't have to. A strong key pair and fail2ban is enough for me. It is not too hard for an attacker to figure out what port ssh is listening on if they really want to.
