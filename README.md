  A guide to building a 4 watt per Pi, Cardano Stake Pool. A reference guide for
  the Pi Pool images.

# Overview & Credits

![](.gitbook/assets/star-forge.jpg)

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is strongly recommended to work through the [Stake Pool School](https://cardano-foundation.gitbook.io/stake-pool-course/) course presented by the Cardano Foundation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you would like to create an .img file of your work that can be flashed for reuse on other Raspberry Pi's you should build on an 8GB sd card. It will take less time to image. See [image creation section](https://pi-pool.adamantium.online/create-.img-file).
{% endhint %}

## Why this guide?

Consolidate and organize the various guides into a single document that can be followed or referenced _specifically_ for running a pool using two \(or more\) Raspberry Pi 4B \(the 8GB version\) and one offline Pi for cold key operations.

Provide documentation of every step taken while building the Pi-Relay, Pi-Core & Pi-Cold images available for bootstrapping pool creation. A reference & guide.

The most popular guides out there are aimed at x86 architecture and '_knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep_' is not always clear. I aim to change that '_with a little help from my friends_'. ðŸŽ¸

## Hardware

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cardano-node & cardano-cli binaries linked to in this guide require aarch64 architecture to run. You **must** use Pi4B 8GB for the Pi-Relay and Pi-Core. For the Pi-Cold img you can use the Pi3B+ or PI4B 4GB or 8GB version with a micro sd card.

{% endhint %}

### Shopping list

* 2 [Pi4B 8GB](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b?variant=31994565689406) version.
* 2 SSD Drives : \(NVMe **low power**, form & speed\).
* NVMe to USB3.1 adapter or whatever works with your drive.
* A 3'rd 64bit capable Pi as an offline machine\(Pi-Cold\).
* Class 10 micro sd card 8GB or larger. Pi-Cold has a desktop and a copy of this guide available in the browser.
* Extra USB flash drives for backing up keys and configurations.
* Consider a single 50+ watt power supply
* Consider a 5 volt gigabit switch
* Consider a case with a fan
