# Pool wallet & staking keys

{% hint style="danger" %}
not done yet sorry.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is very convenient to create your wallet keys from a mnemonic seed. This will allow you to manage the pools wallet from Yoroi or Daedalus & easily restore the pools wallet into any compatible wallet and manage rewards.

cardano-wallet will not build on arm. Below is how to do it with an x86 machine running cardano-wallet and then transfer the keys to your cold offline machine.

It is recommended to download the cardano-wallet binary, check it's sha256 hash & then go offline until keys are safely on the cold machine.
{% endhint %}

## Generate

{% hint style="danger" %}
ðŸ”¥ **Critical Operational Security Advice:** `payment` and `stake` keys must be generated and used to build transactions in cold environment. In other words, your **air-gapped offline Cold machine**. The only steps performed online in a hot environment are those steps that require live data. Namely the follow type of steps:

-   querying the current slot tip
-   querying the balance of an address
-   submitting a transaction
    {% endhint %}

Create a 15-word or 24-word length Shelley compatible mnemonic with [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) or [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) on a offline machine preferred.

### Retrieve x86 cardano-wallet binary

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not using Linux on your local machine you can write Ubuntu to a usb stick and boot from it.
{% endhint %}

Download cardano-wallet to your local machine.

Extract your keys. Update the command with your mnemonic phrase.

```bash
